# Volatility Clustering for 25 Stocks

## Description
In this repository I use K-Means clustering to group 25 stocks into various categories based on their rolling volatilities behavior. Each stock is color coded and an Ellipse is generated for large groups to pinpoint which stocks are outliers from their groups. I also used Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensions of the plot to 2D.
